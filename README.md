# **🌳 Information:**
Natural Regrowth is an immersive addon for [ProtoManly's Weather](https://modrinth.com/mod/protomanlys-weather) that overhauls the aftermath of tornadoes and storms. Instead of leaving permanent, ugly scars in your landscape, storms now leave behind a destroyed, but recovering ecosystem.

# **🌪️ How It Works:**
When a tornado tears through a forest, it no longer simply destroys the trees. Trees that are stripped of their leaves and branches, or completely destroyed now leave behind "Damaged Stumps" (visually represented by stripped wood). Over time (approx. 2-5 in-game days by default), these stumps will naturally heal and transform into saplings, allowing the forest to regrow naturally.

Trees on the edge of a destructive tornado that lose their leaves are also considered "destroyed." Natural Regrowth will place a stripped stump at the bottom indicating damage. Eventually, they will collapse and begin the regrowth cycle as well. This ensures a completely healed scar that enables long term survival playthroughs, and prevents a constantly increasing amount of destroyed forest.
